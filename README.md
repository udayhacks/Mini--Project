CROP PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
  Project Overview
  This project focuses on predicting the price of crops for a particular year based on previous years' data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide accurate price forecasts that can help farmers and stakeholders make informed decisions.

Technologies Used
  Python
  Web Technology
  Machine Learning
Setup and Execution
  Step 1: 
    Install Python
    Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from Python's official website.

  Step 2: 
    Install Dependencies
    After successfully installing Python, install all required dependencies using:
    
    command : pip install -r <path_to_requirements.txt>

  Step 3: 
    Ensure Dataset is Updated
    Make sure that the dataset used for prediction is up to date and properly formatted before running the application.

  Step 4: Run the Application
    Execute the following command to start the project:
    command : python app.py
    
  
This will launch the application and allow users to interact with the crop price prediction model.
