# 🌾 Crop Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the prices of various crops for a given year using machine learning algorithms, based on historical price data. The predictions can assist farmers, traders, and policy-makers in making informed decisions.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predict future crop prices based on historical data
- Easy-to-use web interface
- Built with Python, Machine Learning, and Web technologies
- Scalable and customizable for different crops and regions

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** (for web interface)
- **Scikit-learn / XGBoost / etc.** (for ML models)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data processing)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (visualization, optional)

---

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

### Step 1: Install Python
Make sure Python 3.x is installed. Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-price-prediction.git
cd crop-price-prediction
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Prepare Dataset
- Make sure the dataset (`data.csv` or similar) is up-to-date and formatted correctly.
- Example columns: `Year, Crop, Region, Min Price, Max Price, Average Price`

### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the local server, and you can open the app in your browser at:  
📍 `http://localhost:5000`

## ✅ To-Do / Future Improvements

- Add more crop features (rainfall, soil type, etc.)
- Use LSTM/Time-Series models for better trend capture
- Deploy the app online (e.g., on Heroku, Vercel)
- Enable multi-language support for farmers
