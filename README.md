Setup and Execution

Step 1: Install Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from Python's official website.

Step 2: Install Dependencies

After successfully installing Python, install all required dependencies using:

pip install -r <path_to_requirements.txt>

Replace <path_to_requirements.txt> with the actual path to the requirements.txt file in your project.

Step 3: Ensure Dataset is Updated

Make sure that the dataset used for prediction is up to date and properly formatted before running the application.

Step 4: Run the Application

Execute the following command to start the project:

python app.py

This will launch the application and allow users to interact with the crop price prediction model.
